This repository contains the code and data for the dissertation on Sunspots. The project aims to find the relation between sunspots and activities happening in the sun's atmosphere.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data cleaning**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning tasks, including `cme.ipynb`, `flare.ipynb`, `solar_wind.ipynb`, and `sunspot.ipynb`.

- **data_extraction**: Here, you'll find Jupyter notebooks responsible for data extraction, including `flare.ipynb`, `sunspot.ipynb`, `testing_data.ipynb`, and `wind.ipynb`.

- **in-depth_eda**: This directory contains notebooks for in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various aspects of the data, including `flare.ipynb`, `sunspot.ipynb`, and `wind.ipynb`.

- **initail_eda**: Here, you'll find notebooks for initial exploratory data analysis, including `flare.ipynb` and `sunspot.ipynb`.

- **old**: This directory contains older or deprecated files and notebooks related to the project.

- **in-depth_eda/image**: Subdirectory containing images generated during in-depth EDA, such as correlation heatmaps and distribution plots.

- **initail_eda/image**: Subdirectory containing images generated during initial EDA, such as distribution plots and scatter plots.

- **.ipynb_checkpoints**: Checkpoint files generated by Jupyter Notebook.
